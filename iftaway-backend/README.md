# IFTA WAY - Command Center

## ðŸš¨ DEPRECATED BACKEND

**This backend is no longer needed and has been replaced by Firebase services.**

The application now uses:
- **Firebase Auth** for authentication
- **Firestore** for database
- **Firebase Functions** for serverless backend logic
- **Firebase Storage** for file uploads

This Express.js backend was suspended and should not be used.
